# Description
Drink dispenser (finalised name TBD) is an easy-to-use, customizable liquid mixer, that can be used in multiple applications. The original intention of this machine is to create a cocktail machine that can dispense a percise amount of liquid of any combinations of 5 liquids, however, with its customizable functionalities, it can be used in various applicationsIts. Simplified operating system allows users to add multipel drinks, and set the amount of each liquid from each of the five pumps.


The main goal of this project is to create a user-friendly, easy-to-use smart lock. Although the code was initially tested with an Arduino UNO, the ultimate goal is to create a stand alone device using the atmega328P-PU microcontroller that allows for minimal power consumption. To reduce cost and complexity, future goal includes to develop a version for the attiny85 while maintaining the same fundamental functionalities.
